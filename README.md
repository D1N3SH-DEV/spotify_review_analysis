Spotify Review Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze Spotify reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to derive insights into user sentiment. The analysis focuses on visualizing review sentiment distribution, exploring common words in positive and negative reviews, and evaluating model performance through confusion matrices and ROC curves.

Dataset
The dataset consists of user reviews labeled as either POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. Each review has been processed to remove noise and prepare it for analysis.

Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning and preprocessing of reviews to prepare them for sentiment analysis.
Sentiment Analysis:

Implementation of a machine learning model to classify reviews into positive and negative sentiments.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Sentiment Distribution: Visualized the distribution of positive and negative reviews using count plots.
Word Clouds: Generated word clouds for positive and negative reviews to visualize the most common words in each category.
Top Words Visualization: Created count plots to show the top 10 most frequent words in both positive and negative reviews.
Model Evaluation:

Confusion Matrix: Visualized the performance of the sentiment classification model using a confusion matrix.
ROC Curve: Plotted the ROC curve and calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to assess the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments.
Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, wordcloud
Key Visualizations
Distribution of positive and negative reviews
Word clouds for sentiment categories
Top 10 words in positive and negative reviews
Confusion matrix and ROC curve for model evaluation
Conclusion
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of Spotify reviews, leveraging NLP to gain insights into user sentiment. The visualizations and model evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the applied sentiment analysis techniques.
