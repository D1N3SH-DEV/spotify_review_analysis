# Spotify Review Analysis Project

This dataset consists of 51,000+ user reviews of the Spotify application from the Google Play Store (January - July 2022). The reviews have been scraped to analyze user sentiments and feedback towards the app. Each review has been labeled as either "Positive" or "Negative" based on its sentiment. The distribution of sentiments within the dataset is as follows:

Positive Reviews: 56% of the total reviews. -Negative Reviews: 44% of the total reviews
This dataset can be used to perform various analyses such as sentiment analysis, trend analysis over time, and feature extraction to gain insights into user experience and satisfaction with the Spotify app. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers and developers who want to explore user perceptions and identify areas of improvement for the application.

# Overview
This project aims to analyze Spotify reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to derive insights into user sentiment. The analysis focuses on visualizing review sentiment distribution, exploring common words in positive and negative reviews, and evaluating model performance through confusion matrices and ROC curves.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of user reviews labeled as either POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. Each review has been processed to remove noise and prepare it for analysis.

#  Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning and preprocessing of reviews to prepare them for sentiment analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Implement a machine learning model to classify reviews into positive and negative sentiments.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Sentiment Distribution: Visualized the distribution of positive and negative reviews using count plots.
Word Clouds: Generated word clouds for positive and negative reviews to visualize the most common words in each category.
Top Words Visualization: Created count plots to show the top 10 most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.
Model Evaluation:
Confusion Matrix: Visualized the performance of the sentiment classification model using a confusion matrix.
ROC Curve: Plotted the ROC curve and calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to assess the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments.

#  Technologies Used
Python \
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, wordcloud
